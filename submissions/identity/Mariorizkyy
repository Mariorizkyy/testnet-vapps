## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: VeriChain ID
- **Category**: identity

### Description
VeriChain ID solves the problem of fragmented online identity. Users currently manage multiple wallets, social accounts, and verifications separately. Our vApp creates a unified on-chain identity that is portable across apps, giving users verifiable reputation and privacy controls.

### SL Integration  
Zero-knowledge verification to prove user attributes without revealing private data.

SL attestations to bind wallet addresses to on-chain credentials.

Secure messaging API to allow dApps to confirm user authenticity in real time.
## Technical

### Architecture
Client-side dApp connects to SL for ZK proofs.

Backend service issues and verifies attestations.

Smart contracts manage identity credentials and revocation logic.

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express 
- **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer + Ethereum (for interoperability)
- **Storage**: WALRUS for off-chain data, IPFS for public metadata

### Features
1. Core feature 1 Portable on-chain identity with SL attestations
2. Core feature 2 Privacy-preserving reputation scores using ZK proofs
3. Core feature 3 API for dApps to request and verify credentials instantly

## Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)
- Implement basic SL credential issuance and wallet binding
- Simple React UI for identity registration
- Demo with one verification flow

### MVP (4-8 weeks)  
- Add full feature set (reputation scoring + dApp verification API)
- SL integration hardened for production
- User testing with selected partners

## Innovation
Unlike other identity projects, VeriChain ID combines verifiable reputation + privacy control using SLâ€™s zero-knowledge toolkit. Users can prove they are trustworthy without revealing personal details, making adoption easier for social dApps, DeFi protocols, and DAOs.
